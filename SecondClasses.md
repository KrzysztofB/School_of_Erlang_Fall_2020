# Second classes live coding script

Let's start with creating a new nova project:
```
rebar3 new nova hot_desking
cd hot_desking
```

Since this is not a HTML course I am just copy-pasting prepared HTML and JS code to `hot_desking/src/views/hot_desking_main.dtl` and `hot_desking/src/views/choose_user_and_date.dtl` files.
