# School of Erlang

This repository is a collection of explanations and ordered exercises.
Their purpose is to allow somebody with limited programming experience to enter the world of Erlang.

## First classes

Everything about the first classes can be found on the [First_classes_solutions branch](https://github.com/aleklisi/School_of_Erlang_Fall_2020/tree/First_classes_solutions).

## Second classes

For the remaining part of the classes, we will be creating a hotdesking application.
During second classes we will learn the basics of:
- what an Erlang process is
- how the processes are started
- processes links and monitors
-

See the docs:
[processes](http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/processes.html)
[gen_server](https://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html)
[](https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/gen_server_concepts.html)

During the live coding session, we will implement a gen_server responsible for handling the connection to a database.
